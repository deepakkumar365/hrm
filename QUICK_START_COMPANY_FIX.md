## üîç If It's Still Not Working

### Check the Debug Output First

When you load the Payroll Generate page, look for this in the console:

```
[PAYROLL DEBUG] ===== PAYROLL GENERATE PAGE DEBUG INFO =====
[PAYROLL DEBUG] User: admin (ID: 1)
[PAYROLL DEBUG] ‚úÖ Organization Name: Default Organization
[PAYROLL DEBUG] ‚úÖ Organization Tenant ID: <some-uuid>
[PAYROLL DEBUG] ‚úÖ Found X ACTIVE companies for tenant <uuid>
[PAYROLL DEBUG]    - Default Company (ID: <uuid>, Active: True)
[PAYROLL DEBUG] ===== END DEBUG INFO =====
```

### Run Full Diagnosis

```bash
python diagnose_company_simple.py
```

This creates `DIAGNOSIS_OUTPUT.txt` with complete details about your database setup.

## üîß Manual Verification (Optional)

If you want to check the database directly:

**SQL Commands:**

```sql
-- Check if Organization has tenant_id
SELECT id, name, tenant_id FROM organization;

-- Check if Companies exist and are active
SELECT id, name, tenant_id, is_active FROM hrm_company WHERE is_active = TRUE;

-- Check if Employees have company_id
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hrm_employee WHERE company_id IS NOT NULL;
```
