Overtime Calculation (Monthly)

- Track overtime hours in attendance records, differentiated from normal hours.
- Monthly Overtime Pay computation:
  
  \text{Overtime Pay} = \text{Overtime Hours (Month)} \times \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Multiplier} 
  
  - Indian standard: multiplier = 2.
- Overtime pay appears separately in payroll and reports, calculated automatically at month-end.



Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Predefined Roles:
  - Admin: Full access and configuration rights.
  - Manager/Supervisor: Can operate modules for direct reports/team.
  - Employee: Limited self-service access.
- Permissions enforce which actions and modules are available for each role.
- Access checking middleware validates users before rendering screens or processing actions.



Configurable Payslip Columns

- Admins can add/remove columns on payslips for each pay group or employee type via an easy configuration UI.
- Supports standard, optional, and custom fields: salary, overtime, tax, loans, leave summary, employee ID, project code, etc.
- Visibility and sequence of columns are set per role/group.



Rapid Prototyping and Deployment on Replit

- Use Replit’s built-in database for quick setup—no external DB required at MVP stage.
- Simple forms/tables for input, list, and reporting; minimal UI, focused on workflow and feedback.
- Early, frequent iterations; leverage Replit’s instant deployment and AI tools for code and configuration.
