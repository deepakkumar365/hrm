## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Backup Database ⚠️ CRITICAL

```bash
# PostgreSQL backup
pg_dump -U postgres -d hrms_db > backup_before_enhancement_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Or using Python script
python backup_database.py
```

### Step 2: Run Database Migrations

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd E:/Gobi/Pro/HRMS/hrm

# Check current migration status
flask db current

# Run migrations
flask db upgrade

# Verify migrations applied
flask db current
```

**Expected Output:**
```
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade -> add_enhancements_001
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade -> add_payroll_enhancements
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade -> 2be68655c2bb
```

### Step 3: Verify Database Schema

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
psql -U postgres -d hrms_db

# Check if new tables exist
\dt hrm_employee_bank_info

# Check if new columns exist in payroll_configuration
\d hrm_payroll_configuration

# Expected columns:
# - employer_cpf
# - employee_cpf
# - net_salary
# - remarks

# Exit psql
\q
```

### Step 4: Restart Application

```bash
# Stop current application (if running)
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where Flask is running

# Start application
python main.py

# Or using Flask command
flask run
```

**Expected Output:**
```
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
```

### Step 5: Clear Browser Cache

```
1. Open browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
3. Select "Cached images and files"
4. Click "Clear data"
5. Close and reopen browser
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Migration Fails

**Symptom:** `alembic.util.exc.CommandError: Can't locate revision identified by 'xxx'`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check migration history
flask db history

# If migrations are out of sync, stamp current version
flask db stamp head

# Then run upgrade
flask db upgrade
```

### Issue 2: Bank Info Modal Not Opening

**Symptom:** Clicking Bank Info button does nothing

**Solution:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for JavaScript errors
3. Verify Bootstrap 5 JS is loaded
4. Clear browser cache and reload

### Issue 3: CSV Export Returns 500 Error

**Symptom:** Clicking Export CSV shows error

**Solution:**
1. Check if data exists in database
2. Verify export functions in `routes_enhancements.py`
3. Check server logs for detailed error
4. Ensure `io` and `csv` modules are imported

### Issue 4: Reports Menu Not Visible

**Symptom:** Reports menu doesn't appear in navigation

**Solution:**
1. Verify user role (must be Admin/Super Admin/HR Manager)
2. Check `base.html` for `{% if not is_user %}` condition
3. Clear browser cache
4. Verify `is_user` variable is set in context

### Issue 5: Default Date Not Set in Attendance

**Symptom:** Date filter is empty on page load

**Solution:**
1. Open browser console
2. Check for JavaScript errors
3. Verify `DOMContentLoaded` event listener is present

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Database Queries

**Optimize Reports:**
```python
# Use eager loading for relationships
employees = Employee.query.options(
    db.joinedload(Employee.manager),
    db.joinedload(Employee.payroll_config)
).filter_by(is_active=True).all()
```

**Index Recommendations:**
```sql
-- Add indexes for frequently queried columns
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_hire_date ON hrm_employee(hire_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_attendance_date ON hrm_attendance(date);
CREATE INDEX idx_payroll_status ON hrm_payroll(status);
```

### CSV Export Limits

- Current implementation loads all data into memory
- For large datasets (>10,000 records), consider:
  - Pagination
  - Streaming response
  - Background job processing

---
