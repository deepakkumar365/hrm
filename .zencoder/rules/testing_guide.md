# HRMS Testing Guide - Current Session Fixes

## Payroll Configuration Fix (CRITICAL)

### Test Steps:
1. Log in as **Tenant Admin** or **HR Manager**
2. Navigate to: **Team Manager > Payroll > Payroll Configuration**
3. Verify:
   - ✅ Page loads without errors (should see employees from your organization only)
   - ✅ Search function works
   - ✅ Pagination works (if >20 employees)
   - ✅ Edit/Save payroll config works

### What was fixed:
- Added organization filtering to prevent cross-tenant data leakage
- Super Admin sees ALL employees
- Tenant Admin/HR Manager see ONLY their organization's employees

2. Font sizes are consistent throughout the table
