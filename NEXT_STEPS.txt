COMPANY DROPDOWN FIX - NEXT STEPS FOR USER
================================================================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
✗ Company dropdown on Payroll Generate page is empty or not loading

ROOT CAUSE:
The issue occurs when one of these conditions is true:
1. User's Organization is NOT linked to a Tenant (tenant_id = NULL)
2. No Companies exist for the Tenant
3. Companies are marked as inactive (is_active = FALSE)
4. User has no Organization assigned

================================================================================
IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
================================================================================

STEP 1: Run the Fix Script
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Open PowerShell/Terminal and run:

    cd D:\Projects\HRMS\hrm
    python fix_company_dropdown.py

This script will:
✓ Create a default Tenant if missing
✓ Link all Organizations to the Tenant
✓ Create a default Company if missing
✓ Assign all employees to the Company
✓ Display verification report

Expected output:

    ✅ FIX SCRIPT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!

STEP 2: Verify the Fix
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Make sure application is running:
   python main.py
   
2. Log in to the web application

3. Navigate to:
   Payroll > Generate Payroll
   
4. Check if "Select Company" dropdown now shows companies

STEP 3: If Still Not Working - Run Diagnostic
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Run diagnostic to see what's happening:

    python diagnose_company_simple.py

This creates DIAGNOSIS_OUTPUT.txt with full details.

Look at the console output when you load the Payroll Generate page:

    [PAYROLL DEBUG] ===== PAYROLL GENERATE PAGE DEBUG INFO =====
    [PAYROLL DEBUG] User: admin (ID: 1)
    [PAYROLL DEBUG] User organization_id: 1
    [PAYROLL DEBUG] ✅ Organization Name: Default Organization
    [PAYROLL DEBUG] ✅ Organization Tenant ID: <UUID>
    [PAYROLL DEBUG] ✅ Found 1 ACTIVE companies for tenant <UUID>
    [PAYROLL DEBUG]    - Company: Default Company (ID: <UUID>, Active: True)
    [PAYROLL DEBUG] ===== END DEBUG INFO =====

If you see ✅ marks → Everything is working ✓
If you see ❌ marks → There's still an issue

KEY POINTS TO UNDERSTAND:
================================================================================

The company dropdown works based on this hierarchy:

    Tenant (e.g., "Default Tenant" with code "DEFAULT")
      ↓
    Organization (e.g., "My Organization") 
      ├─ Has tenant_id = Tenant's ID
      ├─ Has Users (you, the logged-in user)
      ↓
    Company (e.g., "Main Branch")
      ├─ Has tenant_id = same Tenant's ID
      ├─ Has is_active = TRUE
      ↓
    Employees
      └─ Have company_id = Company's ID

If ANY link is broken, the dropdown will be empty.

The fix script AUTOMATICALLY creates all these links.

================================================================================
EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX:
================================================================================

✅ Tenant exists
✅ Organization linked to Tenant
✅ Company exists and is active
✅ Employees assigned to Company
✅ Dropdown shows companies
✅ Can select company + month + year
✅ Employee payroll data loads
✅ Can generate payroll
