## Detailed Testing Scenarios

### Test Scenario 1: Matrix Update

**Objective**: Verify access level updates work correctly

**Steps**:
1. Login as Super Admin
2. Go to `/access-control/matrix`
3. Find "Payroll" → "Payroll Management" → "Payroll Generation"
4. In "Tenant Admin Access" column, select "View Only"
5. Verify success message displays
6. Refresh page and verify change persists
7. Check audit log for the change

**Expected Result**: ✅ Access level updates immediately and persists

---

### Test Scenario 2: Matrix Export/Import

**Objective**: Verify export and import functionality

**Steps**:
1. Click "Export as Excel"
2. Save file as `access_matrix_backup.xlsx`
3. Open file and verify structure
4. Modify one cell (change "Editable" to "View Only")
5. Save file
6. Go back to application
7. Click "Import Matrix"
8. Select the modified file
9. Click Import
10. Verify success message
11. Refresh matrix and verify change applied

**Expected Result**: ✅ File exports/imports correctly with changes applied

---

### Test Scenario 3: User Role Mapping

**Objective**: Verify user role assignment works

**Steps**:

## Database Verification Queries

Run these queries to verify everything is set up correctly:

```sql
-- Check table creation
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'hrm_role_access_control';
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'hrm_user_role_mapping';
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'hrm_audit_log';

-- Check default data was created
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_entries FROM hrm_role_access_control;

-- Check user mappings exist
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_mappings FROM hrm_user_role_mapping;

-- Check audit logs
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_logs FROM hrm_audit_log;

-- Check specific access configuration
SELECT module_name, menu_name, 
       super_admin_access, tenant_admin_access, 
       hr_manager_access, employee_access
FROM hrm_role_access_control 
WHERE module_name = 'Payroll' 
LIMIT 5;

-- Check user role mappings
SELECT 
    urm.id, 
    u.username, 
    r.name as role_name, 
    c.name as company_name,
    urm.is_active
FROM hrm_user_role_mapping urm
JOIN hrm_users u ON urm.user_id = u.id
JOIN role r ON urm.role_id = r.id
LEFT JOIN hrm_company c ON urm.company_id = c.id
LIMIT 10;

-- Check recent audit logs
SELECT 
    al.id,
    u.username,
    al.action,
    al.resource_type,
    al.created_at
FROM hrm_audit_log al
LEFT JOIN hrm_users u ON al.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY al.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Known Issues & Resolutions

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| "Table doesn't exist" | Migrations not run | Run Flask migrations or SQL scripts |
| AJAX changes not saving | Blueprint not registered | Verify import in main.py |
| 403 Forbidden error | Not Super Admin | Login with Super Admin account |
| Excel import fails | Wrong format | Check column headers match exactly |
| JavaScript not working | File not linked in template | Verify template inheritance correct |
| Audit logs not created | Function not called | Check change detection in routes |
| User mappings not showing | company_id type mismatch | Verify UUID vs String type |
