## ‚úÖ COMPLETED CHANGES

### 1. **Attendance Bulk Management Enhancement** ‚úÖ

**Scope:** Global (Admin, Manager, HR, Tenant Admin)

**File Modified:** `D:/Projects/HRMS/hrm/templates/attendance/bulk_manage.html`

#### Changes Implemented:

1. **New Bulk Action Buttons (Lines 107-116)**
   - Added "Mark Present" button (green) in header
   - Added "Mark Absent" button (red) in header
   - Both buttons positioned in top-right of attendance table header
   - Small button size (`btn-sm`) for compact UI
   - Icons added for better visual clarity

2. **JavaScript Functionality (Lines 376-424)**
   - `markSelectedAs(status)` function:
     - Works on currently checked employees
     - Shows confirmation popup before applying changes
     - Displays count of selected employees in confirmation
     - Updates attendance status for all selected employees
     - Shows success message after completion
   
   - `showSuccessMessage(message)` function:

     - Positioned at top-right corner (fixed position)
     - Auto-dismisses after 3 seconds
     - Includes close button for manual dismissal
     - Shows checkmark icon for visual feedback

#### How It Works:
1. User checks checkboxes next to employee names to select them
2. User clicks "Mark Present" or "Mark Absent" button
3. Confirmation popup appears: "Are you sure you want to mark X employee(s) as Present/Absent?"
4. Upon confirmation, all selected employees are updated
5. Success message appears: "Successfully marked X employee(s) as Present/Absent"
6. Visual status updates immediately (badges and row colors change)

#### User Experience:
