## 🔧 The 3 Fixes That Were Applied

### Fix #1: CSS Theme Colors ✅
**Problem:** Pages showed greenish colors instead of pure teal  
**Solution:** Added `--primary-green` and `--primary-green-light` CSS variables  
**File:** `static/css/styles.css`  
**Result:** All colors now render in proper teal (#008080)

### Fix #2: Missing Flask-Login ✅
**Problem:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` would fail  
**Solution:** Added `Flask-Login>=0.6.3` to requirements.txt  
**File:** `requirements.txt`  
**Result:** Login system now installs correctly

### Fix #3: Missing python-dotenv ✅
**Problem:** Environment variables wouldn't load from .env file  
**Solution:** Added `python-dotenv>=1.0.0` to requirements.txt  
**File:** `requirements.txt`  
**Result:** .env file loading now works
