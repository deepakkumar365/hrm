## üìä DATA INTEGRITY CHECKS

### Payroll Data Accuracy
```sql
-- Verify attendance filtering
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hrm_payroll 
WHERE days_worked > 22;  -- Should be 0 (max 22 working days)

-- Verify net pay calculation
SELECT id, gross_pay, employee_cpf, 
       (gross_pay - employee_cpf) as calculated_net,
       net_pay,
       CASE WHEN net_pay = (gross_pay - employee_cpf) 
            THEN 'OK' ELSE 'MISMATCH' END as status
FROM hrm_payroll LIMIT 10;

-- Check for null values in critical fields
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hrm_payroll 
WHERE employee_id IS NULL OR gross_pay IS NULL;
-- Should return 0
```

- [ ] No payroll records with >22 working days
- [ ] Net pay = Gross - CPF for all records
- [ ] No null values in critical fields
- [ ] All dates are valid

### Database Integrity
- [ ] Foreign key relationships intact
