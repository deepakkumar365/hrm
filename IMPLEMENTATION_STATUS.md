### üîß TECHNICAL NOTES

#### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- New Tables Created:
1. hrm_designations (id, name, description, is_active, created_at, updated_at)
2. hrm_employee_companies (employee_id, company_id, created_at)
3. hrm_user_roles (user_id, role_id, created_at)

-- Modified Tables:
1. hrm_employees
   - Added: designation_id (FK to hrm_designations)
   - Deprecated: position (kept for backward compatibility)

-- Relationships:
- Employee ‚Üí Designation (Many-to-One)
- Employee ‚Üî Company (Many-to-Many via hrm_employee_companies)
- User ‚Üî Role (Many-to-Many via hrm_user_roles)
```

#### Backward Compatibility
- Old `position` field is maintained but nullable
- Old `company_id` field is maintained as primary company
- Old `role_id` field is maintained as primary role
- New relationships work alongside old fields during transition

#### Role Names in System
The system uses these role names (case-sensitive):
- `Super Admin` (or `SUPER_ADMIN`)
- `Admin` (or `ADMIN`)
- `HR Manager` (or `HR_MANAGER`)
- `Tenant Admin` (needs to be added)
- `Employee` (or `EMPLOYEE`)
