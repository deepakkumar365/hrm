### 1. Use Quick Actions for Baseline

Then selectively change only the exceptions
This is faster than individual selection
```

### 2. Check Employees Filter
```
If you only want specific department:
Can filter employees before marking
(This feature can be added)
```

### 3. Review Before Saving
```
Always review the summary before saving:
- Does the count look right?
- Are Leave/Absent correctly marked?
- Is the date correct?
```

### 4. Use for Past Dates Too
```
Can mark attendance for yesterday or any past date
Useful for:
- Catching up on missed entries
- Correcting data entry errors
- Bulk processing from manual records
```
