### **Q: Filters not responding**

**A:** Make sure you've selected BOTH start and end dates. Both fields must be filled.

**A:** If you enter end date before start date, the system automatically swaps them. This is normal!

### **Q: Don't see employee/department filters**
**A:** You need to be a Manager or Admin to see these filters. Regular employees can't filter.

### **Q: Attendance data is empty**
**A:** Try selecting "This Month" to see if any records exist. You might not have attendance records for the selected date range.

### **Q: Mobile buttons don't show text**
**A:** On mobile, buttons show icons only to save space. Tap the calendar icons to select dates.
