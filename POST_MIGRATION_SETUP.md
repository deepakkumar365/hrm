# üéØ POST-MIGRATION SETUP & GO-LIVE GUIDE

## Overview
This guide covers everything needed after database migration to get production running smoothly.

---

## üìã POST-MIGRATION CHECKLIST

### Immediately After Migration (Within 5 minutes)

- [ ] Verify migration script completed successfully
- [ ] Check for any error messages
- [ ] Confirm production database has data (run verification script)
- [ ] Review migration log file
- [ ] Create timestamp backup of the successful migration

### Before Starting Application (Next 15 minutes)

- [ ] Reset all user passwords to temporary default
- [ ] Verify at least one user can login with temporary password
- [ ] Check database is accessible from application server
- [ ] Verify environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Confirm ENVIRONMENT variable is set to 'production'

### Before Go-Live (Next 30 minutes)

- [ ] Test application startup
- [ ] Verify all pages load without errors
- [ ] Test user login with multiple user types
- [ ] Check organization/company visibility
- [ ] Verify payroll module is accessible
- [ ] Check if reports generate correctly
- [ ] Review application logs for any warnings

---

## üîê STEP 1: PASSWORD MANAGEMENT

### Why This is Critical
After migration, users from development database need a known password to login in production.

### Option A: Reset All Users to Same Password (Recommended)

**Best for:** Initial setup when you want all users to have access immediately

```bash
# Run interactive tool
python prod_password_management.py

# Choose Option 4: Reset ALL users
# Enter temporary password: Noltrion@123
# Confirm: yes

# Result: All users now have Noltrion@123
```

**What happens next:**
- Users login with temporary password
- System forces password change on first login
- Users create their own secure passwords

### Option B: Reset Specific Users

**Best for:** Setting up individual admin accounts

```bash
# Run interactive tool
python prod_password_management.py

# Choose Option 3: Reset specific user
# Enter username: superadmin
# Enter new password: YourSecurePassword123!
# Confirm: yes
```

### Option C: Verify Current Passwords (Testing)

```bash
# Run verification
python test_login_credentials.py

# This tests if all users can login
# Helps identify any password issues
```

### Password Best Practices

‚úÖ DO:
- Use strong passwords (12+ characters)
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Force password change on first login
- Log all password reset operations
- Inform users of temporary password securely

‚ùå DON'T:
- Use simple passwords (123456, password, etc.)
- Share passwords via email or chat
- Store passwords in plain text
- Use same password for all users
- Forget to make users change password

## üöÄ STEP 2: APPLICATION STARTUP

### Pre-Startup Verification

```bash
# Verify environment variables
echo $ENVIRONMENT          # Should be: production
echo $PROD_DATABASE_URL    # Should be: postgresql://...
echo $PROD_SESSION_SECRET  # Should be set

# If any are missing, update .env file
```

### Start Application on Local Machine

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Set production environment
$env:ENVIRONMENT = "production"

# Start application
python main.py

# Expected output:
# [INFO] Running in PRODUCTION mode
# [INFO] Starting HRMS Application...
# * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
export ENVIRONMENT=production
python main.py

# Expected output:
# [INFO] Running in PRODUCTION mode
# [INFO] Starting HRMS Application...
# * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Start Application on Render/Cloud

1. Go to your deployment dashboard
2. Re-enable or restart the service
3. Set environment variables:
   - `ENVIRONMENT=production`
   - `PROD_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...`
   - `PROD_SESSION_SECRET=your-secret`
4. Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)
5. Check deployment logs for errors

### Startup Troubleshooting

**Error: "PROD_DATABASE_URL not set"**
```bash
# Solution: Add to .env file
PROD_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/database
```

**Error: "Cannot connect to database"**
```bash
# Solution: Verify connection
psql $PROD_DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"

# If fails, check:
# - Database is running
# - Credentials are correct
# - Network connectivity
# - Firewall rules
```

**Error: "Permission denied"**
```bash
# Solution: Database user needs privileges
# Contact database admin to grant:
# - CONNECT
# - CREATE
# - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
```

## ‚úÖ STEP 3: LOGIN & FUNCTIONALITY TESTING

### Test User Login

**In browser, go to:**
```
http://localhost:5000/login    (if local)
https://your-app.com/login     (if deployed)
```

**Test with multiple user types:**

1. **Super Admin Login**
   - Username: `superadmin`
   - Password: `Noltrion@123` (or your set password)
   - Expected: See admin dashboard

2. **Manager Login**
   - Username: `manager`
   - Password: `Noltrion@123` (or your set password)
   - Expected: See manager dashboard

3. **Employee Login**
   - Username: `employee`
   - Password: `Noltrion@123` (or your set password)
   - Expected: See employee dashboard

4. **Tenant Admin Login**
   - Username: `tenantadmin`
   - Password: `Noltrion@123` (or your set password)
   - Expected: See tenant admin dashboard

### Verify Force Password Change

On first login after migration:
1. User attempts login
2. System forces password change dialog
3. User enters new password
4. Login successful with new password

### Test Core Features

- [ ] Can view payroll entries
- [ ] Can create payroll
- [ ] Salary slip generation works

**Attendance:**
- [ ] Can mark attendance
- [ ] Can bulk upload attendance
- [ ] Attendance reports work

**Leave Management:**
- [ ] Leave types are available
- [ ] Can apply for leave
- [ ] Can approve/reject leaves

**Reports:**
- [ ] Reports section accessible
- [ ] Can generate sample reports
- [ ] Excel export works

## üìä STEP 4: DATA VERIFICATION

### Verify Master Data

```bash
# Run verification script
python verify_prod_migration.py --detailed

# Should show:
# ‚úÖ Organizations: X records
# ‚úÖ Roles: X records
# ‚úÖ Designations: X records
# ‚úÖ Leave Types: X records
# ‚úÖ Banks: X records
# ‚úÖ Users: X records
```

### Manual Verification Steps

**Check Organizations:**
```sql
-- Run this in database
SELECT COUNT(*) as org_count FROM organization;
SELECT name FROM organization LIMIT 5;
```

**Check Users:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as user_count FROM hrm_users;
SELECT username, email, is_active FROM hrm_users LIMIT 5;
```

**Check Roles:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as role_count FROM role;
SELECT name FROM role;
```

**Check Data Integrity:**
```sql
-- Foreign keys should reference valid records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hrm_users WHERE organization_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM organization);
-- Should return 0 (no orphaned records)
```

### Identify Missing Data

If data seems incomplete:

1. Compare record counts between dev and prod
2. Export missing data from development
3. Manually import into production
4. Or restore backup and retry migration

## üîç STEP 5: APPLICATION LOGS REVIEW

### Where Logs Are Located

**Local Machine:**
```
E:\Gobi\Pro\HRMS\hrm\logs\app.log
E:\Gobi\Pro\HRMS\hrm\logs\error.log
```

**Render/Cloud:**
```
Dashboard ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí View logs
```

### What to Look For

‚úÖ Good Signs:
```
[INFO] Connected to database successfully
[INFO] All tables initialized
[WARNING] (optional, non-critical)
```

‚ùå Problems to Watch For:
```
[ERROR] Database connection failed
[ERROR] Foreign key constraint violation
[ERROR] Import error (missing dependencies)
[CRITICAL] Application failed to start
```

### Fix Common Errors

**Error: "relation 'xyz' does not exist"**
- Migration didn't complete fully
- Run: `python db_migration_to_prod.py --mode full`

**Error: "could not connect to database"**
- Check PROD_DATABASE_URL
- Verify database is running
- Test connection: `psql $PROD_DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"`

**Error: "permission denied"**
- Database user lacks privileges
- Contact database admin

---

## üîÑ STEP 6: ROLLBACK PROCEDURE (If Needed)

### When to Rollback

- Application won't start
- Critical data missing
- Users can't login
- Major functionality broken

### How to Rollback

**Option 1: Restore from Backup**
```bash
# Stop application
# Restore production database from backup
psql $PROD_DATABASE_URL < prod_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql

# Restart application
python main.py
```

**Option 2: Re-run Migration**
```bash
# Fix the issue that caused failure
# Clear production database (if possible)
# Run migration again
python db_migration_to_prod.py --mode full
```

**Option 3: Use Development Database**
```bash
# Temporarily point to development database
# Edit .env: DATABASE_URL=$DEV_DATABASE_URL
# Restart application
# Identify root cause
# Fix and retry migration
```
