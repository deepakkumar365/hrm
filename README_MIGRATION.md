## 🎓 Understanding the Migration

### What Changes?
```
BEFORE: role table
AFTER:  hrm_roles table
```

### What Stays the Same?
- All role IDs (preserved)
- All role data (copied)
- All user-role relationships (maintained)
- Application functionality (unchanged)

### Why Migrate?
To maintain consistent naming convention:
- ✅ hrm_users
- ✅ hrm_employee
- ✅ hrm_company
- ✅ hrm_roles ← NEW
- ❌ role ← OLD
