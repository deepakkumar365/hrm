## üîß Recent Fix Applied

### Issue
Application was failing with:
```
sqlalchemy.exc.ProgrammingError: column hrm_employee.designation_id does not exist
```

### Solution
Temporarily commented out new model additions to allow application to run with existing database schema. All changes are marked with `# UNCOMMENT AFTER MIGRATION` for easy restoration.

### Files Modified
1. `models.py` - Commented out new fields and relationships
2. `routes.py` - Commented out Designation import
3. `routes_masters.py` - Commented out Designation routes

### Current State
‚úÖ **Application is now running normally** with existing database schema.

## üîç Key Technical Details

### Database Changes
- **New Tables**:
  - `hrm_designations` - Master designation data
  - `hrm_employee_companies` - Employee-Company many-to-many
  - `hrm_user_roles` - User-Role many-to-many

- **Modified Tables**:
  - `hrm_employees` - Added `designation_id` foreign key
  - Existing `position`, `company_id`, `role_id` fields maintained for backward compatibility

### Backward Compatibility
- Old fields (`position`, `company_id`, `role_id`) are maintained
- Single role/company access still works
- Gradual migration approach - no breaking changes
- Can run old and new code side-by-side during transition

### Access Control
- **Designation Master**: Super Admin, Admin, HR Manager
- **Employee Management**: Based on existing role permissions
- **Multiple Roles**: User can have multiple system roles (after implementation)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Migration is Required**: The application is currently running with temporary code. Migration must be run to enable new features.

2. **Backup First**: Always backup database before running migration.

3. **Code Restoration**: After migration, all commented code must be uncommented for features to work.

4. **Testing**: Thoroughly test in development before deploying to production.

5. **Rollback Plan**: Keep database backup and rollback SQL ready.
