# Migration Fix Complete ✅

## Problem
The application failed to start with the error:
```
[ERROR] Migration failed: (psycopg2.errors.DuplicateColumn) column "overtime_group_id" of relation "hrm_employee" already exists
```

## Root Cause
The Alembic migration tracking table (`alembic_version`) was out of sync with the actual database state:

1. **The database schema was already complete** - all migrations had been previously applied
2. **Alembic didn't know this** - the version table had inconsistent entries
3. **When the app tried to upgrade**, Alembic attempted to re-run the `add_overtime_group_id` migration, but the column already existed

## Solution
Fixed the Alembic version tracking by:

1. **Analyzed the migration chain** - confirmed there are 16 migrations in a single linear sequence
2. **Identified the correct revision IDs** - fixed naming discrepancies (e.g., `add_payroll_configuration` → `add_payroll_config`)
3. **Set the correct HEAD** - updated `alembic_version` table to only track `008_insert_tenant_company_test_data` as the current HEAD

## Migration Chain (Linear)

add_org_address_uen

  ↓
add_tenant_configuration
  ↓
add_overtime_group_id ← The one that was failing
  ↓
005_add_tenant_company_hierarchy

007_add_tenant_payment_and_documents
  ↓
008_insert_tenant_company_test_data (HEAD)
```

## Files Modified
- **alembic_version table**: Reset to contain only HEAD migration
- No code files needed changes - the issue was purely in database state

## Fix Scripts Created
1. **fix_overtime_migration.py** - Initial diagnostic and first fix
2. **mark_all_migrations.py** - Attempted comprehensive fix
3. **fix_alembic_versions_corrected.py** - Corrected revision IDs
4. **fix_alembic_single_head.py** - Final fix setting correct HEAD

## Verification ✅
The application now starts successfully with:
```
[OK] Migrations completed successfully!
[OK] Default master data created successfully!
```

## How to Start the App
```bash
python main.py
```

The app will automatically:
- Check if migrations have been applied
- Skip re-running (since they're already applied)
- Start the Flask development server at `http://localhost:5000`

## If Issues Persist
If you encounter any migration issues again:

```bash
# Clear Python cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force __pycache__

# Run the app - it will auto-migrate
python main.py
```

## Notes
- All migrations have been verified to create a single linear chain
- The database schema is fully up-to-date with all 16 migrations applied
- The `overtime_group_id` field exists in the `hrm_employee` table
- No data was lost during this fix
